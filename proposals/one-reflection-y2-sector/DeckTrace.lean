Removing the nontrivial fourth inverse-power character in the holdout
finite-cover source. The deck homomorphism is an explicit hypothesis here;
its construction on the common cover is a separate obligation.
Prepared with OpenAI ChatGPT assistance for a contribution through GitHub
account fqlx. Normalized trace and its functoriality are due to the credited
Lean/mathlib authors.
